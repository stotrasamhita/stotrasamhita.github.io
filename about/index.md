In this GitHub repository, we hope to make available high-quality PDFs for printing as well as devices such as Kindle, along with tools to proofread (long-term goal!). Perhaps, it may well be possible to integrate `stotrasamhita.net` with this `github.io` page.

## Credits

### Special Thanks

* Special thanks to [H. L. Prasad](https://hlprasad.wordpress.com/) for all the super TeX macros that underlie _each_ of the PDFs typeset here.
* [SanskritDocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org/), for the most comprehensive resource of Sanskrit stuff, and the source text for some of the stotras in here.
* Thanks to Saketh Nath and Arun Ayyar and a number of friends and family for all the proof-reading help (detailed credits are in the Preface of the main stotra book.)
* Special thanks to [Ulrich Stiehl](http://sanskritweb.de/) for sharing the source files of the Kathaka texts edited by Subramania Sarma
* Diverse books and selfless publishers, who have tried to preserve our rich legacy of stotras, puranas etc.

### Tools

#### Translipi

[Translipi](http://srican.blogspot.in/2007/02/introducing-trans-lipi.html) is an extremely useful tool to facilitate the display of saṃskṛtam texts in various Indian scripts. Presently, it supports, dēvanāgarī, diacritical roman, kannaḍa, malayāḷam, tamizh and telugu. Many thanks to [Shri. Srikanth Subramanian](http://srican.blogspot.in/) for sharing this wonderful tool. [Sahityam](http://sahityam.net), also managed by Shri. Srikanth is indeed one of the inspirations for this site. 

#### Mudgala IME

Practically all the encoding was done with the help of Ajit Krishnan's [Mudgala IME](http://www.aupasana.com/).

#### Sanscript

Another tool that I have used extensively for back-and-forth devanagari/ITRANS conversions, for proof-reading, diffing with other texts and so on is [Sanscript](http://www.learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript).
