In this GitHub repository, we hope to make available high-quality PDFs for printing as well as devices such as Kindle, along with tools to proofread (long-term goal!). Perhaps, it may well be possible to integrate `stotrasamhita.net` with this `github.io` page. You are also free to fork these repositories and typeset your own PDFs.

## Credits

### Special Thanks

* Special thanks to [H. L. Prasad](https://hlprasad.wordpress.com/) for all the super TeX macros that underlie _each_ of the PDFs typeset here.
* [SanskritDocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org/) and all its tireless volunteers, for the most comprehensive resource of Sanskrit stuff, and the source text for some of the stotras in here. Thanks are also due to other excellent resources such as [Prapatti](http://prapatti.com/slokas/slokasbyname.html) by Shri. Sunder Kidambi and Shri. A. S. Rajagopalan.
* Thanks to Saketh Nath and Arun Ayyar and a number of friends and family for all the proof-reading help (_detailed credits are in the Preface of the [StotraSangraha book](https://github.com/stotrasamhita/stotra-sangrahah/raw/master/shloka-print.pdf)_.)
* Special thanks to [Ulrich Stiehl](http://sanskritweb.de/) for sharing the source files of the Kathaka texts edited by Subramania Sarma
* Special thanks also to numerous volunteers who populated YajurVeda texts at [https://sa.wikisource.org/] -- these form the basis of most of the veda texts here.
* Diverse books and selfless publishers, who have tried to preserve our rich legacy of stotras, puranas etc.
* Thanks to Shri. [Raja Venkateswaran](https://github.com/subburaja7) of [Veda Circle, LA](http://veda-circle.org/), we also now have PDFs in multiple scripts (Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit (Chandas font) and IAST)!

### Tools

#### Translipi

[Translipi](http://srican.blogspot.in/2007/02/introducing-trans-lipi.html) is an extremely useful tool to facilitate the display of saṃskṛtam texts in various Indian scripts. Presently, it supports, dēvanāgarī, diacritical roman, kannaḍa, malayāḷam, tamizh and telugu. Many thanks to [Shri. Srikanth Subramanian](http://srican.blogspot.in/) for sharing this wonderful tool. [Sahityam](http://sahityam.net), also managed by Shri. Srikanth is indeed one of the inspirations for this site. 

#### Mudgala IME

Practically all the encoding was done with the help of Ajit Krishnan's [Mudgala IME](http://www.aupasana.com/).

#### Sanscript

Another tool that I have used extensively for back-and-forth devanagari/ITRANS conversions, for proof-reading, diffing with other texts and so on is [Sanscript](http://www.learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript).
